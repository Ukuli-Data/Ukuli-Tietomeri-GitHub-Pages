## Welcome to Tietomeri

Tietomeri is a modular IoT framework that can easily be adapted to various use cases. We are building it in modular smaller components that can be easily modified. The system could easily be adapted for non-IoT use as well.

## What does Tietomeri mean?

Tietomeri means "An Ocean of Information" in Finnish. Our vision is to make sense of the huge amount of information floating on the Internet of Things. Although Tietomeri is meant primarily for Internet of Things projects it would be possible to adapt it to other kinds of data as well. 

## Technologies
Tietomeri is based on open source technologies such as:

- [Arduino](https://github.com/Ukuli-Data/Ukuli-Tietomeri-Arduino) - An open source microcontroller board equipped with sensors and actuators. 

- [Raspberry PI](https://github.com/Ukuli-Data/Ukuli-Tietomeri-RaspberryPI) - More like a computer rather than a microcontroller, can be used for more diverse tasks than Arduino.

- [Node-RED](https://github.com/Ukuli-Data/Ukuli-Tietomeri-Node-Red) - Basically this is a nervous system for IoT devices and other data sources. You can use it to wire together different data sources like IoT devices and build logic from their input - say if Arduino sends a message that the house is too hot Node-RED can send a signal to the heating system to turn the heat down.

- [IOTA](https://github.com/Ukuli-Data/Ukuli-Tietomeri-IOTA) - IOTA is like a Bitcoin for IOT devices. For an example an electric car could use it to pay for the electricity it charges. 

- [MQTT](https://github.com/Ukuli-Data/Ukuli-Tietomeri-Message-Broker) - MQTT is a light messaging protocol meant for IoT devices. Tietomeri uses it to pass data between all of these various components.

- [Cordova](https://github.com/Ukuli-Data/Ukuli-Tietomeri-Cordova) - Cordova makes it possible to build an app controlling Tietomeri for desktop computers, Android phones, iPhones and Windows phones. Basically you make just one app and Cordova creates versions of it for different devices.

- [Data Module](https://github.com/Ukuli-Data/Ukuli-Tietomeri-Data-Analysis) - This module can be very simple or extremely complicated depending on the project. It stores the data coming from the sensors for as long as is needed. It can also use Python data science tools to visualize and analyze the data as required.

These are the most important core modules but more are added and these modules can be modified almost indefinitely based on the use case. 

[Tietomeri](https://tietomeri.digital/) website will open when we are ready for launch. If you are interested in the project [contact us](mailto:tomi.toivio@ukuli.fi) and we can have a discussion about possible collaboration.
